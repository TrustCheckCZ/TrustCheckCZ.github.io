In today’s connected world, privacy and security are two of the most valuable commodities for mobile users. Yet, many mainstream operating systems fall short in fully protecting users from unwanted tracking, data breaches, and vulnerabilities. This is where privacy-centric platforms like DivestOS shine, offering a breath of fresh air to users who prioritize security over convenience. Along with new features like an EXIF-Free Camera, Live CVE Patching, and Integrated Virus Scanning, solutions like DivestOS are revolutionizing the landscape of secure mobile systems.

## What is DivestOS?
[DivestOS](https://divestos.org/) is an Android-based operating system focused on enhancing user privacy, security, and extending device longevity. It strips away unnecessary features, bloatware, and privacy-invading trackers commonly found in stock Android versions. Developed to give users maximum control over their device, DivestOS an open-source LineageOS fork, allowing for greater transparency and trust in how it handles your data.

Unlike traditional mobile operating systems that integrate third-party services for user tracking and data collection, DivestOS strips away Google services and other invasive elements, ensuring you have a cleaner and more secure device.

### Why DivestOS?
DivestOS stands out due to its robust commitment to privacy and security, while offering the following core features:
- Regular Security Updates: Constant patching of vulnerabilities, sometimes years after a device has been officially abandoned by the manufacturer.
- Stripped of Tracking Services: The removal of Google Play Services, combined with hardened privacy controls, helps ensure your personal information remains your own.
- Device Longevity: By keeping old devices secure and up to date, DivestOS extends the usability of devices well beyond their official support lifecycle.

In an era where companies monetize user data and personal information is up for grabs, the philosophy behind DivestOS sets it apart as a truly user-first operating system.

### A Look at New Privacy-First Features
DivestOS brings a comprehensive range of privacy and security features to the table, making it a standout choice for users seeking to protect their data and reduce digital vulnerabilities. Here’s a deep dive into its core features:

1. Monthly Security Updates
    1. All supported devices on DivestOS receive monthly security updates, ensuring that users are protected against the latest threats. Some devices also support incremental updates, which allow for smaller and quicker download sizes. While not all Android Security Bulletins (ASB) patches can be included, DivestOS provides detailed transparency on the patches applied.

2. Automated Kernel CVE Patching
    1. One of DivestOS’s standout features is its Automated Kernel CVE Patching system. The team has developed an automated patch checker combined with a massive database of fixes for over 5,800 Linux kernel vulnerabilities. These patches are applied automatically where possible, bolstering device security across the board.

3. Bootloader Relocking
    1. DivestOS restores the ability to relock the bootloader, a feature tested and functional on 23 devices, with availability for 26 more. Verified Boot is also reinstated and enforced on 36 devices once the bootloader is locked. This significantly enhances device integrity, preventing unauthorized changes to the system.

4. System WebView: Mulch Hardened Chromium
    1. DivestOS includes Mulch, a hardened version of Chromium’s WebView with security enhancements like control-flow integrity and network state partitioning. Mulch is updated independently of the system image through the F-Droid repository, enabling rapid deployment of security updates. This enhancement is made possible through contributions from the Vanadium project.

5. Privacy-First Features
    1. Powerful Tracker Blocker: DivestOS incorporates a highly optimized hosts file designed to block over 900,000 advertising and tracking domains. This file is built by analyzing over 180 million domains, effectively minimizing the risk of trackers infringing on your privacy.

    2. Privacy-Oriented Browser: The Mull Browser in DivestOS is based on Mozilla technology and hardened against fingerprinting techniques through the Tor Uplift and arkenfox-user.js projects. This makes browsing more private and resistant to tracking.

6. Freedom-Oriented Features
    1. FOSS Focused: DivestOS upholds the four freedoms of free software, ensuring users maintain control over their devices and code. It encourages collaboration and reuse of its work, promoting an open ecosystem.

    2. Deblobbed System: Over 700 proprietary blobs are removed during the build process, reducing the attack surface and removing untrusted code. This deblobbing further improves privacy and system security.

    3. F-Droid Included: The inclusion of the F-Droid app catalog ensures access to a wide range of FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) apps that prioritize privacy and security.

7. Extra Features
    1. Robocall Blocker: The built-in Carrion tool automatically blocks calls with spoofed caller IDs using STIR/SHAKEN attestation provided by U.S. phone carriers. It also includes a database of known robocallers to further reduce spam calls.

    2. Free Space Eraser: Extirpater is the first free space eraser for Android, designed to securely wipe unused space on your device to prevent the recovery of deleted files. This is especially useful when migrating from an unencrypted installation or before selling your device.

    3. Malware Scanner: DivestOS features Hypatia, the first open-source real-time malware scanner for Android. It is capable of detecting over 7.2 million malware samples by default, and it can be extended to detect up to 48 million samples.

### Why Privacy and Security Matter More Than Ever
In a world dominated by social media, online shopping, and data-driven services, your personal information is more valuable than ever. Unfortunately, mainstream mobile operating systems and apps have blurred the lines between user privacy and profit, making it difficult to know where your data ends up. Whether it’s a massive data breach or invasive ads following your every move, the dangers of data misuse are real.

Platforms like DivestOS, paired with features such as EXIF-Free Camera and real-time patching, go a long way in giving users back control over their privacy. Instead of relying on external antivirus or permission managers, everything is built into the system in a way that’s streamlined, effective, and easy to use.
