Phone verification is often promoted by platforms as a way to ensure you're human. But don’t be fooled—this isn't the only reason. The primary goal of phone verification is to de-anonymize users if necessary.

Even privacy-focused platforms like Signal, Telegram, or Proton require a phone number to register, and in many countries, it's mandatory to submit ID proof to register a SIM card.

### Privacy-Based Phones

- **Get a Burner Phone**  
  This is fairly simple. Leave your smartphone at home, turned on. With some cash in hand, visit a flea market or a small shop (ideally one without CCTV or surveillance) and buy the cheapest phone you can find. Make sure you don't provide any personal information. The phone only needs to work.

  > *A note on your current phone:*  
  > The idea of leaving your smartphone on is to obscure the fact that you’re using a burner phone. If you turn your smartphone off, it creates a gap in your metadata trail that can be correlated with your burner phone's activation. If possible, leave your phone doing something like playing YouTube videos on auto-play. While this won’t completely eliminate the possibility of being tracked, it makes it more difficult to correlate your activity. Aim to make your phone’s usage pattern look convincing while you go buy your burner.

  For the burner phone, it's recommended to get an old "dumbphone" with a removable battery (like an old Nokia). This will prevent the automatic sending and collection of telemetry and diagnostic data. Also, never connect your burner phone to Wi-Fi.

- **Getting an Anonymous Prepaid SIM Card**  
  This is the most challenging part of the process and the biggest single point of failure. It's becoming increasingly difficult to buy prepaid SIM cards without ID registration due to new KYC (Know Your Customer) regulations.

  There are still some places where it's possible to get anonymous SIM cards. You can check out the [registration policies per country](https://prepaid-data-sim-card.fandom.com/wiki/Registration_Policies_Per_Country) to see where this is allowed.

  Once you find a suitable location, visit the store in person and buy a prepaid SIM card and a top-up voucher with cash. Make sure to verify that no new laws have been passed that would require registration. As always, try to avoid being captured on CCTV, and don't forget to purchase a top-up voucher, as most prepaid cards require one before activation.

## No Money?
If you’re low on money and can’t afford a SIM card, you’ll need to rely on free services. **This is highly discouraged**, as you can’t trust these services and there's a high chance that your data will be sold or tracked.
