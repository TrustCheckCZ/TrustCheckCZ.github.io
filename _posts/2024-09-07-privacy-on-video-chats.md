Popular platforms like Zoom and Microsoft Teams track much more than just your messages. They log unique identifiers, monitor login requests, and collect a range of data that compromises your privacy.

Reports have been surfaced claiming that some video conferencing platforms may allow hosts to remotely access your microphone and camera—**even without explicit permission**, and even when these devices are turned off. 
This presents serious privacy risks, as users may be completely unaware when their audio or video is being accessed.
These claims have been out for **YEARS** and yet people still use their services.

### Privacy Risks

Platforms like Zoom and Teams have been criticized for their invasive data collection practices. Not only do they collect extensive metadata, but they also offer administrators powerful monitoring capabilities, making it easy for your boss or meeting host to access your chat messages, calls, and files shared during meetings.
