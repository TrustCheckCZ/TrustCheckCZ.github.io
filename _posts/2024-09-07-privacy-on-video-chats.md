Popular platforms like Zoom and Microsoft Teams track far more than just your messages. They log unique identifiers, monitor login requests, and collect a host of other data that compromises your privacy.

It has been reported that some video conferencing platforms have the capability for hosts to remotely access your microphone and camera **EVEN WITHOUT** explicit permission, even when these devices are turned off. This poses serious privacy concerns, as users might not be aware of when their audio or video is being accessed.
